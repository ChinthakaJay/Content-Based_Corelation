Here, Only_Gender.py & Only_AgeGender.py files are exact thing that I need to do.

If the item count of function in 'Only_AgeGender.py' are greater than 0, it should recommend items.

If the item count of function in 'Only_AgeGender.py' are less than 0, 'Only_Age.py' should process and it should recommend items.


So other .py files are the things I'm trying to code with web service

Item for gender and age- both
----------------------------------
item: Sports Bags - Diesel
age:45
gender: Female




item for only gender
item : Sports Bags - Puma
gender: Female
